### Core Features

-   **Image-to-Query**: Utilizes a fine-tuned BLIP model to generate precise search queries from product images.
-   **Multi-Platform Scraping**: Scrapes top e-commerce sites (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) to find product listings.
-   **Intelligent Ranking**: Sorts results by the best price and relevance to the user's query.
-   **Interactive UI**: A simple and clean user interface built with Streamlit.

### Getting Started: Setup and Running the Agent

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### 1. Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository and install the required Python packages.

bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## 2. Download the Dataset
The model is fine-tuned on the **Fashion Product Images Dataset**.

Download it from the link in archive (2) following directory structure.

Place the dataset into a directory (e.g., `data/myntradataset/`) and ensure the image paths and descriptions are correctly formatted in a `.csv` file as expected by the fine-tuning script.

---

## 3. Run the Fine-Tuning Script
Execute the `run_finetuning.py` script to start training the model on the fashion dataset.  
This will generate model checkpoints in the `data/checkpoints` directory.

bash
python run_finetuning.py

## 4. Update the Agent to Use the Fine-Tuned Model
After fine-tuning is complete, update the agent to use the newly trained weights:

1. Open the `agent/core.py` file.  
2. Find the line where the `PriceComparisonAgent` is initialized.  
3. Change the parameter:

## 5. Launch the Streamlit App

Now you are ready to run the application! Use the following command in your terminal:

python -m streamlit run app.py


Your web browser should automatically open to the application's UI.

## 6. Test the Application

Image Search: Upload a product image and click "Search for Best Prices".

Text Search: Alternatively, enter a detailed product description in the text box.

The agent will display the generated search query and a table of the best prices found online.

## Development & AI Assistance

The ai_logs file is included in this repository to provide transparency into the development process.
It contains conversations with AI assistants that were instrumental in:

Debugging code

Structuring the agent's logic

Exploring implementation strategies
